<!-- 'remote: true' tells Rails to use Ajax for this form, which allows web pages to send requests asynchronously to the server without leaving the page. We want this so that we don't need to essentially redirect a user back to the user page they're on when they follow/unfollow said user. -->
<%= form_for(current_user.active_relationships.build, remote: true) do |form| %>
  <div>
    <!-- Need to send the 'followed_id' to the controller -->
    <%= hidden_field_tag :followed_id, @user.id %>
  </div>
  <%= form.submit "Follow", class: "btn btn-primary" %>
<% end %>
